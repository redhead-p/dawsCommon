/**
 @mainpage
 This documents the DAWS project.  Current mobile components include
 - a brushed DC PWM traction motor controller for use with
 TI DRV8871 H bridge. With:
        - PI (proportional-integral) control using bemf derived speed error,
        - bemf sampling during gap in pwm pulse train,
        - bemf filtering using a statistical median digital filter and,
        - a simple Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) low pass digital filter
 - RFID reader to read tags embedded in the track.
 - VL53L0X time-of-flight IR range sensors for the detection of buffer stops, rolling stock and other obstacles
 - an IR  drive wheel revolution counter for measuring distance moved (odometer) and estimating speed.

 A differential amplifier measures bemf across
 motor terminals.

 Accessory (static) components include
 - point motor servo drivers
 - quadrature decoder for user input

 Bluetooth Low Energy is used for communications between static and mobile components.

 @brief Fixed point binary

 The low order 8 bits are a fractional representation x/256. Alternatively
 view this as a fixed point binary number.

/**
 ******************************
 @brief Rounding macro
 *********************************

 Macro to round fixed point binary numbers to integers or lower precision etc.
 Equivalent to decimal point rounding by adding 0.5 and then truncating to integer.
 E.g ROUND(x, 8) will round a fixed point FixPnt2408 number to an integer.
 @param v - fixed point binary to be rounded
 @param p - number of binary digits to be rounded out

 @return integer result of rounding

#define ROUND(v, p) ((v + (((long)1) << (p - 1))) >> (p))

/**
 ******************************
 @brief Recursive Filter
 *********************************

 Performs a simple single stage recursive or
 infinite impulse response (IIR) filter where

 y[k] = x[k-1] + alpha*y[k-1]

 and y[k] is the output for this iteration k, x[k-1] is the input for this iteration and
 y[k-1] is the output of the previous iteration.  This is analogous to an analogue RC low pass
 and as in an RC filter, the filter may be cascaded to increase the frequency cut off slope.
 In this implementation alpha takes a value of ((2^n) - 1)/(2^n).  (e.g. 1/2, 3/4, 7/8 and so on).

@note  y is the rolling weighted sum - not the rolling weighted average so
 the filter has a steady state gain of 2^n, which has to be allowed for.
 I.e before use as a filtered value or input to a cascaded filter stage y[k] has to be
 divided by (2^n).

 @param x - input
 @param y - saved output of previous iteration
 @param n - as in alpha expression

 @return - output of this iteration

/** @defgroup hwAssignments Pin assignments etc for various hardwired connections, peripherals etc.
